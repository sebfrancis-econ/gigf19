## ðŸ“˜ Abstract

This thesis investigates the role of state intervention in the industrial development of France and Germany during the nineteenth century. Drawing on the political thought of Machiavelli, Hegel, and List, it conceptualises the state not merely as a regulatory actor, but as a formative institutional force.

Through historical analysis and comparative sectoral data, the study examines how each country pursued divergent modernisation strategies, shaped by distinct institutional legacies and geopolitical constraints. To quantify these dynamics, a panel dataset is constructed and three econometric models are estimated: a Fixed Effects panel model, a First Difference model, and a Difference-in-Differences specification centred on the 1871 German unification.

The findings indicate that sectoral and infrastructural variables explain more of the observed economic variation than national identity or unification alone. These results challenge deterministic interpretations of industrial development. Overall, the thesis contributes to a deeper understanding of economic modernity as a process embedded in political form and strategic governance.
